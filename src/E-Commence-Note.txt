                   

                   E COMMENCE FRONTEND CREATION
                   -----------------------------

            1. Create a folder e-cart, inside it  create frontend and backend 
            2. Project Creation : ng new e-cart-frontend 
            3. Run the frontend : ng s -o
            4. Clean the code in app.component.html
            5. Install 3rd party libraries
                 ->Copy and paste in index.html
                    ->bootstrap link
                    ->fontawesome link
                    ->angular material link
                    ->google fonts   
            6. Creating Components
            7. Lazy loading
                 Lazy loading helps keep initial bundle sizes smaller,
                 which in turn helps decrease load times
             -> Module Generation - ng g m products --route products --module app.module               

            Component create inside the product module

            -> ng g c products/allProducts
            -> ng g c products/viewProduct
            -> ng g c products/cart 
            -> ng g c products/wishlist

            Not included in the product module

            -> ng g c header
            -> ng g c footer
            -> ng g c pageNotFound

            8. Setup Paths   
                http://localhost:4200/ => http://localhost:4200/products/allProducts

                -> products.routing
                const routes: Routes = [
                    { path: 'allProducts', component: AllProductsComponent },
                    { path: 'viewProduct/:id', component: ViewProductComponent },
                    { path: 'cart', component: CartComponent },
                    { path: 'wishlist', component: WishlistComponent },
                    { path: '', redirectTo: 'allProducts', pathMatch: 'full' },
                    { path: '**', component: PageNotFoundComponent }
                ];

            9. Backend Creation

            10. API Integration

              -> create api function in api.services
              -> call that function in corresponding component
              -> display the details of the product
              -> wishlist Integration

              ng g p products/pipes/filter    

            11. Behavior subject

               -> it is used ti share stream of data from one component to another component
               -> its under rxjs library
               -> its a asynchronous function
               -> next() method is used to attach the data
